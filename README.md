## 📋 Project Overview

**Redfin Checker** is a custom-built automation tool designed to **scrape and monitor property listings** from [Redfin.com](https://www.redfin.com/).  
The tool automatically collects, filters, and updates real estate data according to the client’s specified parameters.

This project was delivered as part of a **freelance client contract**, and it serves as a portfolio reference for my Python-based web automation and data scraping work.
